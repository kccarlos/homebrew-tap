# Homebrew formula template for kccarlos/homebrew-tap (Formula/sheepdog.rb).
# Rendered by packaging/homebrew/render.sh from the release's checksums.txt
# after the darwin tarball has been signed and notarized (the homebrew job
# in .github/workflows/release.yml). The placeholders are v0.1.1 and the two
# sha256 sums; Homebrew reads the version from the URL (an explicit
# `version` fails `brew audit --strict` as redundant).

      sheepdog supervises agents running in herdr (https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr).
      Next steps:
        sheepdog demo              # try it without herdr (needs GEMINI_API_KEY)
        sheepdog setup             # set up keys, checks and start at login
        sheepdog doctor            # check the setup
        sheepdog service install   # run it at login
